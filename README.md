# ProjectTitanic

## Introduction
We have to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

training set :should be used to build your machine learning models. we provide the outcome for each passenger. Y

The test set: should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
