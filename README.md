# ProjectTitanic

## Introduction
We have to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## The Data
train.csv: contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board.
test.csv: should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
