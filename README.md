# Project Titanic Python


## Introduction
The object of this Project is apply Machine Learning techniques to predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### Libraries:
- Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Skills used
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning


## The Data
**train.csv:** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board.
**test.csv:** should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
