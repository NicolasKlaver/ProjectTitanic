## Introduction
We have to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## The Data
**train.csv:** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board.
**test.csv:** should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Parts of my script:
### 1) Libraries [Link - Parte 0](https://github.com/NicolasKlaver/Project_Titanic_Survivor/blob/main/Titanic_P0.ipynb)
- Only upload the libraries
### 2) Data analysis [Link - Parte 1](https://github.com/NicolasKlaver/Project_Titanic_Survivor/blob/main/Titanic_P1.ipynb)
- 1) First look to the data
- 2) Data visualization of the features
- 3) Data Cleaning
### 3) Predictions [Link - Parte 2](https://github.com/NicolasKlaver/Project_Titanic_Survivor/blob/main/Titanic_P2.ipynb)
- Do the predictions and choose the best model
